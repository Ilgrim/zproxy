# WIP Zevenet Http proxy

Zhttp is an event-driven and multi-threading L7 reverse proxy. Zhttp supports HTTP and HTTPS by using OpenSSL 1.1.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* A modern C/C++ compiler
* CMake 3.6+ installed
* libssl  (1.1 for now)
* zlib
* doxygen for source code documentation generation

*Note: You can download and build zlib and libssl during the zhttp compilation by enabling BUNDLED_ZLIB and BUNDLED_OPENSSL.*

### Building The Project

#### Git Clone

First we need to check out the git repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abdessamad-zevenet/zhttp zhttp.git
$ cd zhttp.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build && cmake ..
$ make [&& make install]
$ Run bin/zhttp -f /path/to/pound/config/file.cfg

# Check the command line interface controller help output:
$ bin/zhttpctl

# Run the tests: WIP
$ bin/zhttptests
```

#### Project Structure

* `src/*` — C++ code that compiles into a library (libzhttp.a) and the main zhttp binary.
* `src/ctl` — Generate a command line interface binary.
* `test/lib` — C++ libraries used for tests ( Google Test).
* `test/src` — C++ test suite.
* `cmake/*` — Cmake input files.
* `docs/` _ Doxygen configuration file (Doxyfile).
* `build-pkg/` _ docker based automated Debian installation package generation.
* `docker/` _ Files for creation and running a complete GUI IDE (QTCreator) in a docker container based on debian stretch.

#### Quick start guide

By following this guide you will end up having a zhttp deployed and running.

1. Download and compile the zhttp proxy. You can follow the instructions above

2. Take one of the example configuration files at `tests/data`. It is recommended to use `simple_http.cfg` or `simple_https.cfg` and modify it to use your infrastructure.

3. Run `$ bin/zhttp -f /path/to/config_file`

4. Now it is ready! You can check the global proxy status by using the control API.

## Feature Description

API:

- It is possible to do hot backend, service, listener and session changes using the API. Here is the operations allowed by the API.

*All the request must be directed to the zhttp unix socket or to the control IP address and port. The response is going to be a JSON formatted response with all the information requested or the operation result.*

**Get the services status of the listener with the id "listener_id"**

GET http://address:port/listener/listener_id/services

**Get the service with the id "service_id" general status**

GET http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id

**Get the backend with the id "backend_id" general status**

GET http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id/backend/backend_id

**Get any field of a service or backend**

GET http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id/field_name

GET http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id/backend/backend_id/field_name

**Modify any field of a service or backend**

POST {field_name: value} http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id/field_name

POST {field_name: value} http://address:port/listener/listener_id/service/service_id/backend/backend_id/field_name

- Examples of the API usage

**Get all the services status.**

```

**Get the service status**

GET http://localhost/listener/0/service/1/status

```json
 "status": "active"
```

**Disable a backend**

POST {status: disabled} http://localhost/listener/0/service/1/status

Ctl:

- The ctl compile into a single binary zhttpctl, please checkout the zhttpctl manpage to use it.

Tests:

* Tests compile into a single binary `zhttptest` that is run on a command line to run the tests.
* In addition, we support multiple functional tests.

**Functional tests requirements**

- Perl 5.

- Term::ANSIColor perl module

- JSON perl module

- Getopt::Long perl module (It should be installed by default)

- Digest::MD5 perl module

- Digest::MD5::File perl module

- curl

- docker

**Functional tests arguments**

- -http_cfg_file : Path to the config file used by zhttp in the HTTP tests. Default: test_http.cfg

- -https_cfg_file : Path to the config file used by zhttp in the HTTPS tests. Default: test_https.cfg

- -ip : Destination IP/URL used to do the requests. Default: localhost

- -port : Port used to do the requests in the HTTP tests. Default: 8000

- -port_https : Port used to do the requests in the HTTPS tests. Default: 8443

- -post_file : Path to the custom file to be send in the POST request tests. Default: data/test_text.txt

- -binary : Path to the zhttp binary. Default: ../build/bin/zhttp

- -https : If this flag is set the HTTPS tests are going to be executed.

- -no_zhttp : If this flag is set, zhttp is not going to be launched.

**Usage examples**

```bash
# Runs the functional tests over the backend without starting zhttp.
zhttp_functional_tests -no_zhttp

# Runs the functional tests enabling HTTPS tests
zhttp_functional_tests -https

# Runs the functional tests over the backend without starting zhttp, setting a different ip and port.
zhttp_functional_tests -https -no_zhttp -ip 192.168.100.20 -port 8080 -port_https 8443
```
